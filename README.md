## Covid Map App
# AwesomeProject Branch
This is the react native Hello World Tutorial

# Master Branch
This application pulls real-time COVID data and prints markers on a Google Map for all the available data points. When the map is loaded, the user can tap on each data point and a bubble with the number of confirmed cases present in that country will show on the screen.

A video is also added for user reference.

All required API keys have been removed for safe keeping. If you desire to run the application locally, an api key is required for the COVID data and for the google maps.

The COVID API Key can be obtained here: https://rapidapi.com/Gramzivi/api/covid-19-data
The Google API Key can be obtained here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key

These are the packages required to run the application locally
